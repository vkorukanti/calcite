## 1.7.0 / (Under Development)
{: #v1-7-0}

This is the first release of Avatica has an independent project. (It
is still governed by Apache Calcite's PMC, and stored in the same git
repository as Calcite, but releases are no longer synchronized, and
Avatica does not depend on any Calcite modules.)

One notable technical change is that we have replaced JUL (`java.util.logging`)
with [SLF4J](http://slf4j.org/). SLF4J provides an API that Avatica can use
independent of the logging implementation. This is more
flexible for users: they can configure Avatica's logging within their
own chosen logging framework. This work was done in
[CALCITE-669](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-669).

If you have configured JUL in Calcite/Avatica previously, you'll
notice some differences, because JUL's `FINE`, `FINER` and `FINEST`
logging levels do not exist in SLF4J. To deal with this, we mapped
`FINE` to SLF4J's `DEBUG` level, and mapped `FINER` and `FINEST` to
SLF4J's `TRACE`.

Compatibility: This release is tested on Linux, Mac OS X, Microsoft
Windows; using Oracle JDK 1.7, 1.8; Guava versions 12.0.1 to 19.0;
other software versions as specified in `pom.xml`.
